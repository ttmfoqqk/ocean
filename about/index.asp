				<b class="color_green">What is OCEAN?</b><br>
				OCEAN (Open alliance for iot standard) is a global partnership based on open source and IoT standards. <br>
				OCEAN aims to promote the development and commercialization of IoT platforms, products, and services by <br>
				widespread adoption of IoT standards-compliant open source.<br>
				<br>
				OCEAN is responsible for releasing the source code for IoT standards as open source and helping companies <br>
				including SMEs collaborate each other and create new innovative IoT products and services under the global <br>
				partnership, finally establishing a global IoT ecosystem.<br>
